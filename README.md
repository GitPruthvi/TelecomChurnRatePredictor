# TelecomChurnRatePredictor

The major problem going around for the telecom companies these days is the customer churn rate. Many customers are leaving their telecom partners because of the better offers they receive from other providers or for many other reasons.

From this project, we are trying to find the factors which would help the company be aware of why a particular customer is leaving/staying with them. By building a predictive model, we are trying to predict if a customer would stay with them or would leave their company by considering referring to their past data history.

Please go through the project report file to get a detailed explanation about this project and the findings.
